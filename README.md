# PHASE-TYPE-DISTRIBUTION-FOR-LOS-PREDICATION
Effective resource requirement forecasting is necessary to reduce the escalating cost of care by ensuring optimum
utilization and availability of scarce health resources. Patient hospital length of stay (LOS) and thus resource requirements depend
on many factors including covariates representing patient characteristics such as age, gender, and diagnosis. We therefore propose
the use of such covariates for better hospital capacity planning.
Likewise, estimation of the patient’s expected destination after
discharge will help in allocating scarce community resources. Also,
probable discharge destination may well affect a patient’s LOS in
hospital. For instance, it might be required to delay the discharge
of a patient so as to make appropriate care provision in the
community. A number of deterministic models such as ratio-based
methods have failed to address inherent variability in complex
health processes. To address such complexity, various stochastic
models have therefore been proposed. However, such models fail to
consider inherent heterogeneity in patient behavior. Therefore, we
here use a phase-type survival tree for groups of patients that are
homogeneous with respect to LOS distribution, on the basis of covariates such as time of admission, gender, and disease diagnosed;
these homogeneous groups of patients can then model patient
flow through a care system following stochastic pathways that are
characterized by the covariates. Our phase-type model is then
extended by further growing the survival tree based on covariates
representing outcome measures such as treatment outcome or
discharge destinations. These extended phase-type survival trees
are very effective in modeling interrelationship between a patient’s
LOS and such outcome measures and allow us to describe patient
movements through an integrated care system including hospital,
social, and community components.
